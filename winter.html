<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
 <p class="speech">Leave me alone... ASTROFF</p>
 <h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
 <p class="speech">Or in love with the professor's wife?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">She is my friend.</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
<p class="speech">Already?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">What do you mean by "already"?</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
<p class="speech">A woman can only become a man's friend after having first been his acquaintance and then his beloved--then she becomes his friend.</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">What vulgar philosophy!</p>

<h5 class="HELENA">HELENA</h5>
<p class="speech">My dear boy, I would with all my heart, but do listen to reason; everybody in the house is asleep.</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
<p class="speech">Play!</p>

<p class="direction">[HELENA plays softly.]</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
<p class="speech">I want a drink. Come, we still have some brandy left. And then,as soon as it is day, you will come home with me.</p>
<p class="direction">[He sees SONIA, who comes in at that moment.]</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF">ASTROFF</h5>
<p class="speech">I beg your pardon, I have no collar on.</p>

<p class="direction">[He goes out quickly, followed by TELEGIN.]</p>

<h5 class="HELENA">HELENA</h5>
<p class="speech">Uncle Vanya, you and the doctor have been drinking! The good
fellows have been getting together! It is all very well for him, he has
always done it, but why do you follow his example? It looks dreadfully
at your age.</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">Age has nothing to do with it. When real life is wanting one must create an illusion. It is better than nothing.</p>

<h5 class="HELENA">HELENA</h5>
<p class="speech">Our hay is all cut and rotting in these daily rains, and here you
are busy creating illusions! You have given up the farm altogether.
I have done all the work alone until I am at the end of my
strength--</p>
<p class="direction">[Frightened]</p>
<p class="speech">Your eyes are full of tears!</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">Tears? Nonsense, there are no tears in my eyes. You looked at me then just as your dead mother used to, my darling-- </p>
<p class="direction">[He eagerly kisses her face and hands] </p>
<p class="speech">My sister, my dearest sister, where are you now? Ah, if you only knew, if you only knew!</p>
