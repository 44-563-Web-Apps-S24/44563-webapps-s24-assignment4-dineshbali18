<h5>VOITSKI</h5>
<p>Soon the rain will be over, and all nature will sigh and awake
refreshed.This wonderful feeling of mine will be wasted
and lost as a ray of sunlight is lost that falls into a dark chasm, and
my life will go with it.</p>

<h5>HELENA</h5>
<p>I am as it were benumbed when you speak to me of your love, and I don't know how to answer you. Forgive me, I have nothing to say to you.</p>
<p>[She tries to go out]</p> 
<p>Good-night!</p>

<h5>VOITSKI</h5>
<p>[Barring the way]</p> 
<p>If you only knew how I am tortured by the
thought that beside me in this house is another life that is being lost
forever--it is yours! What are you waiting for? What accursed philosophy
stands in your way? Oh, understand, understand----</p>

<h5>HELENA</h5>
<p>[Looking at him intently]</p> 
<p>Ivan, you are drunk!</p>

<h5>VOITSKI</h5>
<p>Perhaps. Perhaps.</p>

<h5>HELENA</h5>
<p>Where is the doctor?</p>

<h5>VOITSKI</h5>
<p>In there, spending the night with me. Perhaps I am drunk,
perhaps I am; nothing is impossible.</p>

<h5>HELENA</h5>
<p>Have you just been drinking together? Why do you do that?</p>

<h5>VOITSKI</h5>
<p>Because in that way I get a taste of life. Let me do it,
Helena!</p>

<h5>HELENA</h5>
<p>You never used to drink, and you never used to talk so much. Go
to bed, I am tired of you.</p>
