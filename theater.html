        <p>HELENA. [Looking at him intently] Ivan, you are drunk!</p>

        <p>VOITSKI. Perhaps. Perhaps.</p>

        <p>HELENA. Where is the doctor?</p>

        <p>VOITSKI. In there, spending the night with me. Perhaps I am drunk,
        perhaps I am; nothing is impossible.</p>

       <p> HELENA. Have you just been drinking together? Why do you do that?</p>

       <p> VOITSKI. Because in that way I get a taste of life. Let me do it,
        Helena!</p>

       <p> HELENA. You never used to drink, and you never used to talk so much. Go
        to bed, I am tired of you.</p>
