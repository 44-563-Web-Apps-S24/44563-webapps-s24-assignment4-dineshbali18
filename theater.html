<p class="speech">Soon the rain will be over, and all nature will sigh and awake
refreshed.This wonderful feeling of mine will be wasted
and lost as a ray of sunlight is lost that falls into a dark chasm, and
my life will go with it.</p>
<p class="direction">[beingsad and looking at sky]</p>

<h5 class="HELENA"></h5>
<p class="speech">I am as it were benumbed when you speak to me of your love, and I don't know how to answer you. Forgive me, I have nothing to say to you.</p>
<p class="direction">[She tries to go out]</p> 
<p class="speech">Good-night!</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="direction">[Barring the way]</p> 
<p class="speech">If you only knew how I am tortured by the
thought that beside me in this house is another life that is being lost
forever--it is yours! What are you waiting for? What accursed philosophy
stands in your way? Oh, understand, understand----</p>

<h5 class="HELENA"></h5>
<p class="direction">[Looking at him intently]</p> 
<p class="speech">Ivan, you are drunk!</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">Perhaps. Perhaps.</p>

<h5 class="HELENA"></h5>
<p class="speech">Where is the doctor?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">In there, spending the night with me. Perhaps I am drunk,
perhaps I am; nothing is impossible.</p>

<h5 class="HELENA"></h5>
<p class="speech">Have you just been drinking together? Why do you do that?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">Because in that way I get a taste of life. Let me do it,
Helena!</p>

<h5 class="HELENA"></h5>
<p class="speech">You never used to drink, and you never used to talk so much. Go
to bed, I am tired of you.</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">He is really ill.</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF"></h5>
<p class="speech">What is the matter with you to-night? You seem sad. Is it
because you are sorry for the professor?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">Leave me alone.</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF"></h5>
<p class="speech">Or in love with the professor's wife?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">She is my friend.</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF"></h5>
<p class="speech">Already?</p>

<h5 class="VOITSKI">VOITSKI</h5>
<p class="speech">What do you mean by "already"?</p>

<h5 class="ASTROFF"></h5>
<p class="speech">A woman can only become a man's friend after having first been
his acquaintance and then his beloved--then she becomes his friend.</p>
